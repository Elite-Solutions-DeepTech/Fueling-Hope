# Fueling-Hope: predicting the future of blood donation
### Abstract:
Now  a days we are facing many problems due to blood demand and shortage. At the time of hospital, medical practices, surgeries, and etc. on our daily lives Here we are creating a application which can helps us to overcome the problem which are facing in this scenario... We are using machine learning algorithms to sort the problem. Mainly svm (support vector machines)is an algorithm with efficiency of 98.4%..We analysed the blood centre details including contact information and blood groups which are present there .We can create a dashboard which is having the attributes like blood storage centre name , location, contact information and blood groups which can be preserved there and also recruitment of blood donors by using our application. By virtually method we can contact willing blood donors by SMS method
